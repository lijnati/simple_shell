# Simple Shell Team Project
This is a simple shell project developed as an assignment for the ALX Software Engineering Course. It is a basic implementation of a shell in the C programming language. This shell provides a command-line interface to interact with the operating system.

## Features
    Basic command execution: You can execute simple commands such as ls, pwd, cd, and others.
    Built-in commands: The shell includes built-in commands like cd and exit.
    Command chaining: You can chain commands using the ; delimiter, e.g., command1 ; command2.
    Input/Output redirection: You can redirect input and output using > (output redirection) and < (input redirection).
    Pipes: You can use pipes to connect multiple commands, e.g., command1 | command2.
